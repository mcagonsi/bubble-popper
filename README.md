# Bubble Popper Game

A React Native mobile game built with Expo CLI for CP4282 Programming for Mobile Devices.

## Game Description

Bubble Popper is a simple one-screen mobile game where:
- Bubbles rise from the bottom of the screen every 0.5 seconds
- Players tap anywhere to shoot a vertical red laser
- Lasers pop bubbles for points (+1 point per bubble)
- Game lasts for 120 seconds
- Final score is displayed with a "Play Again" option

## Features Implemented

1. **Bubble Spawner**: Creates a circle every 0.5s at bottom with random x position
2. **Bubble Motion**: Moves each bubble straight upward until it leaves the top
3. **Laser Shot**: On any tap, draws a vertical red line from bottom that lasts 0.3s
4. **Hit Test**: If laser crosses a bubble, removes bubble and adds +1 point
5. **Score Label**: Shows "Score: N" in the top-left corner
6. **Countdown Timer**: Starts at 120s, when it hits 0, freezes play and shows Game Over with final score and Play Again button

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Expo CLI
- **Language**: Pure JavaScript (.js files)
- **Framework**: React Native
- **Animation**: Built-in Animated API
- **Input**: Built-in Pressable component

## Installation & Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Install Expo CLI globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/cli
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BubblePopper
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Game

### On Android Emulator/Device
```bash
npm run android
```

### On iOS Simulator/Device (macOS only)

## How to Play

1. Tap "Start Game" to begin
2. Bubbles will start spawning from the bottom and floating upward
3. Tap anywhere on the screen to shoot a red laser vertically

## Scoring

- Each bubble popped = +1 point
- Game duration = 120 seconds
- Goal: Get the highest score possible!

## Development Notes

- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management
- Implements game loops using setInterval for bubble spawning and animation
- Uses Pressable component for touch input handling
- Collision detection between laser and bubbles using distance calculation
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
